        <p class="text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300">
          Proper PPE is the first line of defense against workplace hazards. This includes hard hats, safety glasses, steel-toed boots, 
          high-visibility vests, and appropriate respiratory protection when needed.

        <p class="text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300">
          Regular safety training sessions ensure all workers are aware of potential hazards and proper safety procedures. 
          This includes emergency response protocols and equipment operation safety.
